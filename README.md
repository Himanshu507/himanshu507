About me
### Hi, I'm Himanshu! ðŸ‘‹

I'm very excited and very worried about the potential of AI, which is why I am learning the use of AI and MCP's, and currently working as a QA Automation Engineer at Aristocrat Gaming.
 
As an accomplished **MCA** post-graduate with a deep-rooted interest in **quality assurance**, I have 6 years of experience in Testing (Automation + Manual) with strong expertise in API testing and CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) and test automation framework design. I also have solid architecture knowledge and recently built a Pipeline Analysis Tool using MongoDB, React, and FastAPI to optimize our release workflows.

Iâ€™m passionate about driving shift-left testing, improving release velocity, and ensuring product quality through modern test strategies.
